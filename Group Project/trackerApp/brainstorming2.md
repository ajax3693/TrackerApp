By AJ Cardoza

* **What**: L!fe is a single app that connects the most used apps in everyday life. It's an all in one that includes your social media, entertainment, fitness, and calendar. You can share your favorite photos or stories, look up movies, exercise routines or even share your calendar. Also allows users to remain interactive by allowing users to create weekly activites/challenges.
* **Who**: L!fe targets those who are looking for a closer connection to your friends and family. Unlike the majority of social media where you can spend hours trolling through various posts of random people. L!fe focuses on creating the core group to share your everyday life with. 
* **Why**: L!fe encourages users to stay connected while sharing meaningful memories and remain engaged with family and friends without presenting they typically fake social media images so often created. This isn't an app for the world it's and app for you.
* **Challenges**: Creating the perfect app collection that would apply to everyone. Time constraints building an app that has many different aspects may be harder to acheive. Also as there are already many social media, entertainment and fitness apps already out there creating one that is unquie from a design perspective could require more time in the design process.

## APP 3
**LightWork Fitness App**
By Max Karey

What: Lightwork is a Fitness app that is designed to be an all-in-one app for when you go to the gym. Often when using an app for the gym you are often navigating between various applications to control music, monitor timers, get information/ideas on workouts and post or view pictures/videos.
Who: Lightwork targets any user who is interested in getting more involved in fitness, this app is great for an experienced athlete who trains in a commercial gym, but it will also appeal to someone who is working out from home and just getting started.
Why: Nowadays life is becoming more and more sedentary and that is having long term effects on people. Lightwork helps people become more active and encourages users to take better care of themselves by promoting a healthy lifestyle through activity and nutrition. 
Challenges: UI and UX will always be difficult with these types of apps because people always have different opinions with how what they think about presentation. I think another challenge could be to successfully implement a social media aspect of the app.
